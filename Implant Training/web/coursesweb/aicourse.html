  <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
  <p>
    Machine learning is a branch of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves training models on large datasets and using them to make accurate predictions or decisions based on new data.
  </p>

  <h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
  <p>
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. NLP is used in applications like chatbots, language translation, sentiment analysis, and voice assistants.

  <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
  <p>
    Computer Vision is a field of AI that focuses on enabling computers to gain a high-level understanding of digital images or videos. It involves the development of algorithms and models that can analyze and interpret visual data, allowing machines to recognize objects, detect patterns, and make decisions based on visual input. Computer vision has applications in areas like object recognition, image and video analysis, and autonomous vehicles.

  <h2>Robotics</h2>
  <div class ="airoboticsimg"></div>
  <p>
    Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines AI, mechanical engineering, and electronics to create machines capable of performing tasks autonomously or with minimal human intervention. AI plays a crucial role in robotics by enabling robots to perceive and interact with the world, make decisions, and adapt to changing environments. Robotics finds applications in various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, and exploration.
