                <div class="cplusimg"></div>
                <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that extends the C programming language. It is a compiled language and widely used for systems programming, game development, and building high-performance applications. C++ offers powerful features such as object-oriented programming, template metaprogramming, and low-level memory manipulation.</p>

                <h2>C++ Features</h2>
                <div class="cplusfeatureimg"></div>
                <br></br>
                <p>C++ includes a rich set of features, including:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming:</strong> C++ supports classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, allowing developers to create modular and reusable code.</li>
                  <li><strong>Templates:</strong> C++ templates provide a mechanism for generic programming, allowing code to be written in a way that can handle multiple data types.</li>
                  <li><strong>Standard Template Library (STL):</strong> The STL provides a collection of generic data structures and algorithms, making it easier to implement common operations without reinventing the wheel.</li>
                  <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> C++ allows manual memory management through concepts such as dynamic memory allocation and deallocation using the <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> keywords.</li>
                  <li><strong>Performance:</strong> C++ is known for its performance as it offers low-level control over system resources and direct hardware access.</li>
                </ul>
              </section>

                <h2>C++ Development Tools</h2>
                <div class="cplustools"></div>
                <br></br>
                <p>There are several popular development tools and frameworks available for C++ development. Some of them include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):</strong> IDEs like Visual Studio, Eclipse, and CLion provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing C++ code.</li>
                  <li><strong>Build Systems:</strong> Tools like CMake and Make help in automating the build process and managing dependencies.</li>
                  <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Frameworks like Unreal Engine and Unity are widely used for developing games using C++.</li>
                  <li><strong>Embedded Systems:</strong> C++ is often used for embedded systems development, and tools like Arduino and PlatformIO provide a platform for programming microcontrollers.</li>
                </ul>
