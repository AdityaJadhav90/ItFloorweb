    Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that allow computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It involves the study of statistical models and algorithms that automatically analyze and interpret patterns in data, enabling machines to improve their performance on specific tasks with experience.

  <h2>Supervised Learning</h2>
  <p>
    Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data, meaning it is provided with input data along with corresponding correct output. The algorithm learns from this labeled dataset to make accurate predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. Examples of supervised learning algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <h2>Unsupervised Learning</h2>
  <p>
    Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, meaning it has no prior knowledge of correct output. The algorithm learns to find patterns, structures, or relationships in the data without any specific guidance. Common unsupervised learning algorithms include clustering algorithms, dimensionality reduction techniques, and generative models.

  <h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
  <p>
    Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to interact with an environment and improve its performance through trial and error. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on its actions, and it learns to take actions that maximize the cumulative reward over time. Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied in areas like game playing, robotics, and autonomous systems.
